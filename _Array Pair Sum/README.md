# Array Pair Sum

## Problem

Given an integer array, output all the unique pairs that sum up to a specific value k.

So the input:

pair_sum([1,3,2,2],4)

would return 2 pairs:

 (1,3)
 (2,2)

NOTE: FOR TESTING PURPOSES CHANGE YOUR FUNCTION SO IT OUTPUTS THE NUMBER OF PAIRS

## Example

Return: 2
```
pair_sum([1,3,2,2],4)
```

## Solution
The O(N) algorithm uses the set data structure. We perform a linear pass from the beginning and for each element we check whether k-element is in the set of seen numbers. If it is, then we found a pair of sum k and add it to the output. If not, this element doesnâ€™t belong to a pair yet, and we add it to the set of seen elements.

The algorithm is really simple once we figure out using a set. The complexity is O(N) because we do a single linear scan of the array, and for each element we just check whether the corresponding number to form a pair is in the set or add the current element to the set. Insert and find operations of a set are both average O(1), so the algorithm is O(N) in total.
