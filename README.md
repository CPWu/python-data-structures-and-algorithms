# Python - Data Structures and Algorithms

Here you will find implementations of popular data structures and algorthms written in Python with detailed explanations of how they work.

If you're a computer science student who needs to learn this stuff for exams -- or if you're a self-taught programmer who wants to brush up on the theory behind your craft -- you've come to the right place!
