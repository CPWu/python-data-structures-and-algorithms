# Doubly-Linked List

Goal: Use Python to Create a Doubly-Linked List

The Doubly-Linked List is a sequential access data structure which stores data in the form of Nodes. Compared to the Linked List, the Double-Linked List is able to traverse both forwards and backwards using pointers. 

Common Linked List Operations: 

- Add to Head
- Remove from Head
- Add to Middle
- Remove from Middle
- Add to Tail
- Remove from Tail

## Complexity (Worst Case)

Task  | Big-O | Name |
------| ----- | ----- |
**Accessing** | O(n) | linear | 
**Searching** | O(n) | linear |  
**Inserting** | O(1) or O(n) | constant/linear |
**Deleting**  | O(1) or O(n) | constant/linear |
