# Binary Search

## Problem

Write a function that takes in a sorted array of integers as well as a target integer. The funcion should use the Binary Search algorithm to determine if the target integer is contained in the array and should return its index if it is, otherwise -1. 

## Example

Output: target = 33
```
array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 61, 71, 72, 73]

```
