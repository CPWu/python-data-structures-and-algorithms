# Contiguous Subarrays

## Problem

You are given an array 'arr' of N integers. For each index i, you are required to determine the number of contiguous subarrays that fulfill the following conditions: 
- The value at index i must be the maximum elementin the contiguous subarrays, and
- These contiguous subarrays must either start from or end on index i.

## Example

Return: [1, 3, 1, 5, 1]
```
arr = [3, 4, 1, 6, 2]
```
