# Min Max Stack

## Problem

Goal: Write a MinMaxStack class for a MinMax Stack. The class should support:
- Pushing and popping values on and off the stack.
- Peeking at the value at the top of the stack.
- Getting both the minimum and the maximum values in the stack at any given point in time.

All class methods, when considered independently, should run in constant time and with constance space.

## Example

```
MinMaxStack(): - // instantiate stack
push(5): - 
getMin(): 5
getMax(): 5
peek(): 5
push(7) - 
getMin(): 5
getMax(): 7

```
