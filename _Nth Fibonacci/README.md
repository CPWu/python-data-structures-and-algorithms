# Nth Fibonacci

## Problem

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is 0, the second number is 1, and the nth number is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

Important note: The fibonacci is often defined with its first two numbers as F0=- and F1=1. For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonaaci sequence is F0; therefore, getNthFib(1) is equal to F0, getNthFib(2) is equal to F1, etc...

## Example

Return: 5 // 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
```
n=6
```

## Complexity
Time = O(n)
Space = O(1)

## Solution
