Dictionaries are one of the most abstract data structures, in computer science you can also find them as Maps and Associative Arrays. Dictionaries store data in key/value pairs. The key's  in a key/value pair can be of any primitive data type you can think of. There are two restrictions when it comes to dictionaries.
- Every key can only appear once iwthin the dictionary
- Each key can only have one value

Dictionaries are implemented using Hash Tables.
