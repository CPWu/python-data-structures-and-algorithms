# Singly Linked List Cycle Check

## Problem

Given a singly linked list, write a function which takes in the first node in a singly linked list and returns a boolean indicating if the linked list contains a "cycle".

A cycle is when a node's next point actually points back to a previous node in the list. This is also sometimes known as a circularly linked list.

## Example

Return: true
```
array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence = [1,6,-1,10] 
```

## Complexity
Time = O(n)
Space = O(1)

## Solution

To solve this problem we will have two markers traversing through the list. marker1 and marker2. We will have both makers begin at the first node of the list and traverse through the linked list. However the second marker, marker2, will move two nodes ahead for every one node that marker1 moves.

By this logic we can imagine that the markers are "racing" through the linked list, with marker2 moving faster. If the linked list has a cylce and is circularly connected we will have the analogy of a track, in this case the marker2 will eventually be "lapping" the marker1 and they will equal each other.

If the linked list has no cycle, then marker2 should be able to continue on until the very end, never equaling the first marker.
