# Recursion

Goal: Use Python recursively.

## Overview

What is Recursion?

There are two main instances of recursion.
- The first is when recursion is used as a technique in which a function makes one or more calls to itself.
- The second is when a data structure uses smaller instances of the exact same type of data structure when it represents itself.

Why use Recursion?

Recursion provides a powerful alternative for performing repetitions of tasks in which a loop is not ideal. Whenever you are trying to develop a recursive solution it is very important to think about the base case, as your solution will need to return the base case once all the recursive cases have been worked through.

## Memoization

Memoization effectively refers to remembering ("memoization" -> "memorandum" -> to be remembered) results of method calls based on the method inputs and then returning the rememebred result rather than computing the result again. You can think of it as cache for method results. We'll use this in some of the interview problems as improved versions of a purely recursive solution.
