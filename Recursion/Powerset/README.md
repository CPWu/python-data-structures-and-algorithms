# Powerset

Goal: Use Python to implement Powerset

## Overview

Write a function that takes in an array of unique integers and returns its powerset

The powerset P(x) of a set x is the set of all subsets of X. For example, the powerset of [1,2] is [[], [1], [2], [1,2]].

Note that the sets in the powerset do not need to be in any particular order.
