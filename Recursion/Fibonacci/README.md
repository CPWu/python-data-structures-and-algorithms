# Fibonacci 

Goal: Use Python to implement Fibonacci Sequence

## Overview

Implement a Fibonacci Sequence in three different ways:
- Recursively
- Dynamically (Using memoization to store results)
- Iteratively

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...`
