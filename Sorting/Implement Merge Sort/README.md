# Implement Merge Sort

Given a list of numbers, your task is to sort it using Merge Sort algorithm.
Example:
Input: [ 5, 8, 3, 9, 4, 1, 7 ]
Output: [ 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 ]
Notes:
Constraints:
1 <= Length of the array <= 4*105.
-109 <= Any number in the array <= 109.
Custom Input:
Input Format:
The first line contains the length of the input array.
The numbers in the array are then given in separate lines.
Input for “Example” above would be:
7
5
8
3
9
4
1
7
Output Format:
The output contains the sorted version of the input array. Each number is given in a separate line.
Output for “Example” above would be:
1
3
4
5
7
8
9
