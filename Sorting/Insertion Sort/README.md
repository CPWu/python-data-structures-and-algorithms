# Insertion Sort

Goal: Use Python to implement Insertion Sort.

## Overview

The insertion sort always maintains a sorted sublist in the lower positions of the list. Each new item is then "inserted" back into the previous sublist such that the sorted sublist is one item larger. Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
