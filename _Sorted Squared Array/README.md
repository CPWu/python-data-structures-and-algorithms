# Sorted Squared Array

## Problem

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squares of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.

## Example

Return: [1,4,9,25,36,64,81]
```
array = [1,2,3,5,6,8,9]

```

## Complexity
Time = O(nlogn)
Space = O(n)

## Solution
