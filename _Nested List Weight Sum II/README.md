# Nested List Weight Sum II (Leet Code)

## Problem

You are given a nested list of integers nestedList. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

The depth of an integer is the number of lists that it is inside of. For example, the nested list [1,[2,2],[[3],2],1] has each integer's value set to its depth. Let maxDepth be the maximum depth of any integer.

The weight of an integer is maxDepth - (the depth of the integer) + 1.

Return the sum of each integer in nestedList multiplied by its weight.

Constraints:

1 <= nestedList.length <= 50
The values of the integers in the nested list is in the range [-100, 100].
The maximum depth of any integer is less than or equal to 50.

## Example

Output: 8
```
Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
```

Output: 17
```
Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
```
