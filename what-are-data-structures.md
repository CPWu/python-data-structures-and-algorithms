# What are data structures?

A data structure is a way to store, organize and manage information or data in a way that allows you to the programmer to easily access or modify the values within them.

Data structures and the algorithms used to interact, modify, and search through them provide the backbone for many of the programs a developer will end up writing.

Each of the data structures in this repository are designed for the sole purpose of storing information and allowing the end user to access and manipulate that information in an efficient, effective way. But each one differs in the manner that they accomplish this.
