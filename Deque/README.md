# Deque

Goal: Use Python to Create a Deque Class. 

## Overview

A sequential access data structure in which we add elements at the head or tail of the data structure.

Queue Methods: 
- Deque() creates a new queue that is empty. It needs no parameters and returns an empty deque.
- addFront() adds a new item to the head of the deque. It takes an object and increases the size of the deque by one.
- addRear() adds a new item to the tail of the deque. It takes an object and increases the size of the deque by one.
- removeFront() removes an item at the head of the deque. 
- removeRear() removes an item at the tail of the deque. 
- isEmpty() tests to see whether the deque is empty.
- size() returns the number of items in the deque.
